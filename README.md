## Dataset
Our dataset download process follows the [ReferIt3D benchmark](https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d). Specifically, you will need to (1) download `sr3d_train.csv` and `sr3d_test.csv` from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DS4uQq7fCmbJHeE-rEbO8G1-XatGEqNV), and (2) download scans from ScanNet and process them according to this [link](https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d/blob/eccv/referit3d/data/scannet/README.md). This should result in a `keep_all_points_with_global_scan_alignment.pkl` file.
